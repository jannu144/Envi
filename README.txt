Project Purpose:
The purpose of our project is to reduce civiliansâ€™ carbon footprint. We aimed to achieve this by creating a website that tracks the most common ways people impact environmental health. Take transportation, where the average American uses 23.30 gallons of gas per week. Our goal is to try and reduce this number at the individual level by promoting alternatives to driving a car like public transportation, walking, carpooling, or biking. We also analyze two other common utilities, water usage and general waste management. The user can track their data and see their weekly impact compared to the average American. With this information, we hope to inspire and motivate users to be conscious of their daily decisions regarding these topics and the overall future of our planet.

Technologies Used:
Figma, React.js, CSS, JavaScript, HTML, VS Code, GitHub

Problems We Faced:
The first problem we faced was when we were brainstorming ideas for our overall design. We tended to look at more specific aspects rather than the big picture which caused us to delay our final product. However, the biggest problem our team ran into was integrating our Figma design with the React.js web app. Some of the designs did not translate over to the web app as perfectly as we had hoped. We spent many hours researching how to resolve this issue and came across many helpful resources. Unfortunately, we did not get our desired result but are still proud of what we came up with regardless.
